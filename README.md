# 1TBS - The One True Bocal Style checker

**Work in progress**

**1TBS** stands for "the one true Bocal style". This is a "norminette",
a C brace style checker written in Python.

But unlike the "official" one, this style checker is not a buch of crappy
regex getting so easily confused.
The 1TBS checker is based on a carefully designed tokenizer and an
authentic hand-written recursive descent parser.
